                <h5> What is COVID-19?</h5>
                <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>

            <div>
                <h5>How does the virus spread?</h5>
                <p>COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.

                    COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:
                   <ol>
                    <li>Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.</li>
                   <li> Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.</li>
                    <li>Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.</li>
                    For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">How COVID-19 Spreads page</a> to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself. </p>

            <div>
                <h5>Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?</h5>
                <p>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol</p>

            </div><br><br>
            <div>
                <h5>What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?</h5>
                <p>People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.</p>
            </div><br><br>
            <div>
                <h5>What are the new variants? Are they more contagious?</h5>
                <p> When a virus has one or more new mutations it’s called a variant of the original virus. Currently, there are two variants of major concern.
                <ol> <li>DELTA(B.1.617.2).: This variant is nearly twice as contagious as earlier variants and might cause more severe illness.</li><li>OMICRON (B.1.1.529).: This variant might spread more easily than other variants, including delta. But it’s not yet clear if omicron causes more severe disease.</li></ol><br><br></p>
